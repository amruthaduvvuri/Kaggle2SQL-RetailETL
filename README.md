# ðŸ”„ Retail Orders ETL & SQL Analytics Project

This project is an **end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built using Python and MySQL. It automates the process of extracting a retail dataset via Kaggle API, transforming it using `pandas`, and loading it into a MySQL database. Post-load, business-critical SQL queries are executed to derive key insights.

## ðŸš€ ETL Process Overview

### âœ… 1. Extract
- Used Kaggle API to programmatically download the dataset  
- Unzipped and loaded `orders.csv` into a pandas DataFrame

### âœ… 2. Transform
- Cleaned missing or invalid values  
- Converted data types (dates, floats, etc.)  
- Derived useful features (e.g., year, month from `order_date`)

### âœ… 3. Load
- Connected to MySQL using SQLAlchemy + PyMySQL  
- Loaded transformed DataFrame into a table (`df_orders`)  
- Verified the load with basic sanity queries
